\begin{abstract}

This tutorial teaches a person how to match basketball player IDs between different databases and in other words deduplicate the players between the sources. The reason that this tutorial can be useful is when a player's name is different between the database sources and a the user wants to match that person's stats between the databases. To achieve this tutorial, you have to parse the data to find the data that matches between the sources and it will map the ids between the sources. The tutorial is written by Ryan \textcite{Tutorial} on GitHub.
